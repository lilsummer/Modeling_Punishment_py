# The thriving of punishers - a python model

A course project for CSCI8551 Intelligent Agents. Click here for
[Final report] (https://github.com/lilsummer/modeling_punishment_py/blob/master/final_report-3/final_report.pdf)

Punishment based on social voluntary cooperation has been evolving for a long time. In the study of Hauert et al., a model has been utilized to illustrate the merits of punishment. In this project we plan to:

  - Rebuild the original model
  - Add geographical constaints to the agents
  - Add enforced tax policy
  - Combine information constaints and enforced tax policy
  - Examine the impact of variations and parameters in the model

### Results
